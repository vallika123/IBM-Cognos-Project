# IBM-Cognos-Project
Key Tasks and Responsibilities:  
**Data Collection:**  
Gathering data from multiple real-world sources, ensuring data relevance and completeness for the analysis.
Working with structured and unstructured datasets, applying best practices for efficient data extraction.

**Data Wrangling and Preparation:**  
Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format by handling missing values, normalizing, and aggregating data.
Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy for robust data manipulation and preparation for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset.
Summarizing and visualizing data distribution, correlations, and statistical properties to inform further analysis.

**Statistical Analysis and Data Mining:**  
Applying statistical techniques to identify key metrics, trends, and insights relevant to the business challenge.
Leveraging data mining techniques and tools like Scikit-learn to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data.

**Data Visualization:**  
Creating various types of visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and regression models to effectively communicate insights.
Utilizing advanced Python visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate clear and impactful data visuals.

**Interactive Dashboard Creation:**  
Building an interactive dashboard using tools like Cognos and Python's Dash framework to allow stakeholders to explore the data dynamically.
The dashboard will feature interactive elements such as filters, charts, and summaries, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time data exploration.

**Data Analysis Report:**  
Preparing a comprehensive report that includes an executive summary, detailed analysis, and conclusions based on the data.
The report will be structured to effectively communicate the analysis process and insights to various stakeholders, focusing on actionable recommendations derived from the data.
The final deliverable will showcase technical competence in using Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis, SQL for querying relational databases, and BI tools for data reporting.  

**Technologies and Tools Demonstrated:**  
Jupyter Notebooks: For performing iterative analysis and documenting the workflow.  
SQL and Relational Databases (RDBMS): For querying and managing datasets in relational databases, extracting valuable insights.  
Python Libraries: Including Pandas for data wrangling, Numpy for numerical analysis, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Scipy for statistical analysis.  
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating sophisticated visualizations that help stakeholders understand complex data.  
Cognos Analytics: For developing interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision-making within the organization.
